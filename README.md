# MLOps Data Processing Application 

A streamlined data processing application built with Python and Streamlit for MLOps workflows. This application provides an intuitive interface for data preprocessing, splitting, and validation tasks.

## Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- CSV file upload and processing
- Configurable train-test split parameters
- Real-time data validation and processing
- Automatic artifact generation
- Comprehensive logging system
- Docker support for containerized deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mlops
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Direct Execution
```bash
streamlit run scripts/app.py
```

#### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
docker build -t mlops-app .
docker run -p 8501:8501 -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data -v ${PWD}/artifacts:/app/artifacts -v ${PWD}/logs:/app/logs mlops-app
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Use the sidebar to configure processing parameters:
   - Test Split Size (0.1 to 0.4)
   - Random State (0 to 100)
3. Upload your CSV file using the file uploader
4. Click "Process Data" to start the processing
5. View the results:
   - Training and validation data samples
   - Dataset statistics
   - Processing logs

## 📁 Input Data Format

The application expects CSV files with the following columns:
- `text`: The input text data
- `summary`: The corresponding summary or target variable

## Output

Processed data is saved in the `artifacts` directory:
- `train_processed.csv`: Training dataset
- `val_processed.csv`: Validation dataset

Logs are stored in:
- `logs/mlops.log`: Application logs

## Configuration

Environment variables can be set in a `.env` file:
```env
ARTIFACTS_DIR=artifacts
```

## Docker Support

The included Dockerfile provides a containerized environment for the application. Build and run commands are provided above in the "Running the Application" section.

## Logging

The application includes comprehensive logging:
- Info level: General processing information
- Error level: Processing and validation errors
- Logs are saved to `logs/mlops.log`
